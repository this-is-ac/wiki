For our experiments, we use the default models provided by tesseract in tessdata. Since all the inputs are in
Marathi, we set lang = 'mar'. 

For other Indic languages including Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Meetei Meyak, Oriya, Punjabi, Santali, Tamil and Telugu,
the Indic OCR package (https://indic-ocr.github.io/tessdata/) provides some models which can be tested.
